# Bachelors-Thesis-Marie-Jarisch
This repository contains the example models used in the bachelor's thesis "Connecting BIM with BPM's Conceptual Modeling". The model files with the file extension ".rvt" were modeled in [Revit](https://www.autodesk.de/products/revit/overview?us_oa=dotcom-us&us_si=9553da6f-2ec6-4b25-b536-2ef2b12bdcf9&us_st=revit&us_pt=RVT&term=1-YEAR&tab=subscription&plc=RVT), the files with the file extension".nwf" in [Navisworks Manage](https://www.autodesk.de/products/navisworks/overview?us_oa=dotcom-us&us_si=ba95ec68-33c1-408a-88a8-cf5568061b4f&us_st=Navisworks&us_pt=NAV&plc=NAVMAN&term=1-YEAR&tab=subscription).

Loading the [architectural](/example_architectural.rvt), [structural](/example_structural.rvt) and the [MEP model](/example_mep_before.rvt) into Navisworks simultaneously after modeling them in Revit creates the [initial coordination model](/coordination_model_before.nwf) that here already includes two defined collision tests which can be found in the "Clash Detective". To resolve the collision between the architectural and the MEP model, the MEP was [updated](/example_mep_after.rvt). Loading the [architectural](/example_architectural.rvt), [structural](/example_structural.rvt) and the [updated MEP model](/example_mep_after.rvt) into Navisworks will now create an [updated coordination model](/coordination_model_after.nwf). The collision test between the architectural and the MEP model will now mark the collision as resolved.
